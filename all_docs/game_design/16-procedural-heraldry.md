## 16. Procedural Heraldry

### 16.1 Concept

Every faction receives a procedurally generated coat of arms rendered in ASCII art. Heraldry is not decorative -- it derives from the faction's culture, values, and history.

### 16.2 Heraldry Generation

Each coat of arms is composed of:

**Shield Shape.** Selected from templates appropriate to faction culture: classic shield (knightly kingdoms), round seal (maritime republics), totem-style (tribal confederations).

**Field Division.** Standard heraldic patterns (per pale, per fess, quarterly, per bend, per chevron) rendered in box-drawing characters. Number of divisions reflects faction complexity.

**Charges (Symbols).** ASCII art symbols from cultural identity: animal totems, weapons (militaristic), stars (religious/magical), tools (trade-focused), natural features (geographically defined).

**Colors.** Derived from primary terrain (mountain = gray/silver, forest = green, desert = gold/tan) modified by values (aggressive + red, scholarly + blue, religious + purple).

### 16.3 Heraldic Evolution

Coats of arms are not static:
- Revolution replaces arms with new ideology
- Dynasty change modifies for new ruling house
- Territory expansion adds elements from conquered peoples
- Religious conversion replaces secular symbols
- Political union combines arms (quartering)

Each version is archived, creating a visual history of political evolution viewable in the Timeline.

### 16.5 Display and Use

Arms appear in faction inspector panels (large rendering), on the world map as territory markers (abbreviated), in battle event narratives ("under the banner of the crimson eagle"), and in diplomatic event descriptions. A gallery shows all factions' current and historical arms, creating a visual chronicle of political evolution.
