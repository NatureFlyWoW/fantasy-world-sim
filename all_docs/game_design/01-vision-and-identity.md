## 1. Vision and Identity

### 1.1 What Aetherum Is

Aetherum is a **digital terrarium for civilizations**. The player seeds a fantasy world with initial conditions, then watches as thousands of interconnected systems produce emergent stories that no human author scripted. History itself is the primary content.

The closest existing reference point is Dwarf Fortress's Legends Mode, but Aetherum diverges in three critical ways:

- **Where Dwarf Fortress treats history generation as a preamble to fortress gameplay, Aetherum treats history as the product.** There is no subsequent gameplay mode. The unfolding centuries are what you came for.

- **Where Dwarf Fortress presents events as database entries, Aetherum transforms them into literary prose.** Five narrative tones, 281 templates, an unreliable chronicler system, and micro-narrative vignettes turn raw simulation data into readable stories.

- **Where Dwarf Fortress gives the player no agency over unfolding history, Aetherum introduces a carefully constrained cultivation mechanic.** The player acts as an invisible gardener -- nudging events through 17 influence actions without ever commanding them.

The result is a system that produces authentic-feeling fantasy narratives -- complete with political intrigue, personal drama, magical catastrophes, religious upheaval, and generational sagas -- that surprise even the person who built the world.

### 1.2 The Experience Promise

You press play. The event log fills with the daily life of a young world. You notice a scholar named Elara discovering an ancient artifact in a remote ruin. You click her name -- the inspector opens, showing her as curious, ambitious, slightly reckless, with a strained relationship to her mentor at the Ivory Academy who expelled her for unauthorized research. You bookmark her.

Fifty simulation-years later, the narrative panel describes a "Magical Renaissance" sweeping the continent. You trace the cause-effect chain backward through the event cascade view and discover it leads to Elara's artifact discovery. Her research paper spread to three kingdoms, inspired a generation of mages, led to the founding of a new academy, and produced court wizards who shifted the political balance of power.

But you also notice a religious order has declared magic heretical in response to the growing mage influence, and a charismatic paladin is gathering followers to wage a holy war against the arcane. The world is heading toward a schism that Elara set in motion without ever intending to -- and you can trace every link in the chain.

That is the experience Aetherum creates.

### 1.3 What Aetherum Is Not

Aetherum is not a strategy game. You do not command armies or manage economies. It is not an RPG -- you do not control a character. It is not a city builder, a 4X game, or a roguelike. It is a simulation that you observe, explore, and gently tend. The closest analogy from outside gaming is watching a nature documentary about civilizations -- except you can rewind time, branch history, and occasionally drop a seed to see what grows.
